## SECTION 1: GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### 1.1 Term and Termination.

#### 1.1.1 Term.

Unless earlier terminated as provided in this Section 1 or specified in an Order Form/SOW (as applicable), this Agreement and the licenses granted hereunder shall be effective as of the Commencement Date and will continue until the expiration or termination of the Term specified in the Order Form ("**Subscription Term**"). If no term is specified in the Order Form/SOW for a Subscription, the Subscription Term for Subscription will be twelve (12) months. The Subscription Term for the Subscription will automatically renew for periods of twelve (12) months at Webiny's then-current pricing unless either party provides written notice of its intention not to renew to the other party at least sixty (60) days prior to expiration of the current Term.

#### 1.1.2 Termination for Convenience. Account Cancellation.

Either party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and the license granted herein upon written notice in the event the other party fails to perform or observe any material term or condition of this Agreement and such default has not been cured within thirty (30) days (or such other longer period as agreed to by the parties) after written notice of such material breach to the other party. If Customer elects to terminate an Order Form/SOW or this Agreement, it is Customer's responsibility to notify Webiny by sending a termination notice in an email to sales@webiny.com. If Webiny elects to terminate an Order Form/SOW or Agreement, it is Webiny's responsibility to notify Customer by sending a termination notice in an email to [legal@customer.com]. Either party may also terminate this Agreement immediately if the other party: (a) terminates or suspends its business; (b) becomes subject to any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding; (c) becomes insolvent or subject to direct control by a trustee, receiver or similar authority; or (d) is wound up or liquidated, voluntarily or otherwise.

#### 1.1.3 Effect of Termination; Survival.

If this Agreement terminates or expires for any reason: (i) the Subscription Term for the Software and/or Service will immediately end; (ii) ninety (90) days after the effective date of any expiration or termination of the Agreement or any Services (the "Transition Period"), any Subscription Licenses in the Order Form/SOW will automatically terminate, and after the Transition Period, Customer will no longer have the right to use the Software or the Service; (iii) if any Fees were owed for Services provided prior to termination, Customer must pay those Fees immediately and Customer shall pay the applicable Fees for use of the Software and/or Services during the Transition Period; (iv) within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the Transition Period, Customer must destroy all copies of the Software in Customer's possession or control, and certify in writing to Webiny that Customer has done so; and (v) after the conclusion of the Transition Period, each Party will promptly return (or, if the other party requests it, destroy) all Confidential Information belonging to the other to the extent permitted by the Service. Except in the case of a breach of this Agreement by Customer, all pre-paid license fees, on a pro-rata basis, and all unused fees for Professional Services shall, in each case, be promptly refunded to Customer within thirty (30) days of the effective date of termination of this Agreement. Any provisions which by their nature should reasonably survive will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement or an Order Form.

During the Transition Period and for a reasonable period thereafter, Webiny shall provide reasonable cooperation and assistance to Customer, upon Customer's written request (email accepted), in transitioning the terminated Services to an alternate service provider. Such cooperation and assistance as provided by Webiny to Customer pursuant to this paragraph shall be billed to Customer as Professional Services.

### 1.2 Payment.

#### 1.2.1 Fees.

Customer agrees to pay the Fees in full, upfront without deduction or set-off of any kind, in the currency and on the dates (if any) specified in the Order Form/SOW. Customer must pay the Fees within thirty (30) days of the Webiny invoice date. Except as otherwise set forth herein (for example, in Section 1.1.3), amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable. If Customer fails to pay any undisputed Fees within the time specified herein, Webiny's sole remedies shall be to: (i) recover all undisputed and unpaid Fees; (ii) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (iii) if Customer makes a late payment (whereby a late payment means a payment made 90 days or more after the invoice date) more than two times during the course of this Agreement, then Webiny may terminate this Agreement and/or the applicable Order Form/SOW. Customer is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties, and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on Webiny's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

#### 1.2.2 Disputed Fees.

Customer may withhold from payment any and all payments and amounts Customer disputes in good faith, pending resolution of such dispute, provided that Customer: (i) timely renders all payments and amounts that are not in dispute; (ii) notifies Webiny of the dispute prior to the due date for payment, specifying in such notice the amount in dispute and the reason for the dispute; (iii) works with Webiny in good faith to resolve the dispute promptly; and (iv) promptly pays any amount determined to be payable by resolution of the dispute. Webiny shall not withhold access to the Software, any of the Services, or fail to perform any obligation hereunder by reason of Customer's good faith withholding of any payment or amount in accordance with this Section or any dispute arising therefrom.

Webiny may not increase the license fee for the Software at any time during the Subscription Term (except for the addition of licenses). Webiny may increase fees for any support or Professional Services hereunder during the Subscription Term solely on an annual basis effective on each anniversary of the commencement date, provided that Webiny: (i) gives Customer at least 90 days' prior written notice of any such pricing change; and (ii) only increases pricing to reflect its actual cost increases and, in any case, does not increase pricing by a percentage that exceeds the then most-recently published CPI. No increase in pricing shall be effective unless made fully in compliance with the provisions of this Section.

#### 1.2.2 Purchasing Additional Subscription Licenses.

Customer may obtain additional Subscription Licenses under this Agreement by submitting a request through Webiny's sales team. If Customer purchases additional licenses, Customer must pay the then-currently applicable Fees for them, prorated for the balance of the applicable Term, provided however, that in no event will the per license fee for the additional licenses exceed 10% of the per license fee for the initial licenses. Upon renewal of Customer's Subscription Licenses for another Subscription Term, Webiny will invoice all Subscription Licenses at once on an annual basis unless otherwise specified in an Order Form/SOW.

#### 1.2.3 Professional Services.

Upon Customer's request for Professional Services, Webiny will provide an SOW detailing such Professional Services. Webiny will perform the Professional Services described in each SOW. Webiny will control the manner and means by which the Professional Services are performed and reserves the right to determine personnel assigned. Webiny may use third parties to perform the Professional Services, provided that Webiny first obtains Customer's prior written approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (each such approved third party, a “Permitted Subcontractor”). Customer's approval shall not relieve Webiny of its obligations under this Agreement and Webiny shall remain responsible for the acts and omissions of Permitted Subcontractors.

Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by an authorized representative of the parties, Customer is and shall be the sole and exclusive owner of all right, title, and interest in and to the Deliverables, including all intellectual property rights therein. Webiny agrees, and will cause its personnel to agree, that with respect to any Deliverables that may qualify as a “work made for hire” as defined in 17 U.S.C. §101, such Deliverables are hereby deemed a “work made for hire” for Customer. To the extent any Deliverables do not constitute a “work made for hire”, Webiny hereby irrevocably assigns, and shall cause its personnel to irrevocably assign to Customer, in each case without additional consideration, all right, title, and interest throughout the world in and to the Deliverables, including all intellectual property rights therein. Webiny shall cause its personnel and Permitted Subcontractors to irrevocably waive, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any and all claims such personnel may now or hereafter have in any jurisdiction to so-called “moral rights” or rights of droit moral with respect to the Deliverables. Upon the reasonable request of Customer, Webiny shall, and shall cause its personnel and Permitted Subcontractors to, promptly take such further actions, including execution and delivery of all appropriate instruments of conveyance, as may be necessary to assist Customer to prosecute, register, perfect, or record its rights in or to any Deliverables. If Webiny desires to utilize, implement or incorporate a Deliverable as part of the Software offered broadly to Webiny's customer base, Customer and Webiny shall negotiate in good faith as to an equitable resolution.

Customer acknowledges and agrees that Webiny retains all right, title, and interest in and to any Pre-Existing Materials or Feedback used or developed in connection with performing the Professional Services, including software, tools, specifications, ideas, concepts, inventions, processes, techniques, and know-how. Webiny hereby grants Customer a limited, irrevocable, perpetual, fully paid-up, royalty-free, non-transferable (except in accordance with Section 1.8.3 (Assignment)), non-sublicenseable, worldwide license to use, perform, display, execute, reproduce, distribute, transmit, modify (including to create derivative works), import, make, have made, sell, offer to sell, and otherwise exploit any Pre-Existing Materials or Feedback to the extent incorporated in, combined with or otherwise necessary for the use of the Deliverables for any and all purposes. All other rights in and to the Pre-Existing Materials are expressly reserved by Webiny.

Customer and its licensors are, and shall remain, the sole and exclusive owner of all right, title, and interest in and to the Customer Content, including all intellectual property rights therein. Webiny shall have no right or license to use any Customer Content except solely during the Subscription Term to the extent necessary to provide the Software and Services to Customer. All other rights in and to the Customer Content are expressly reserved by Customer.

### 1.3 Confidentiality.

Neither Party will use the other Party's Confidential Information, except as permitted under this Agreement. Each Party agrees to maintain in confidence and protect the other Party's Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care as it uses for its own information of a similar nature, but in any event at least a reasonable degree of care. Each Party agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorised disclosure of the other Party's Confidential Information, including, without limitation, disclosing such Confidential Information only to its Representatives who (i) have a need to know such information, (ii) are party to appropriate agreements sufficient to comply with this Section 1.3, and (iii) are informed of the restrictions on use and disclosure set forth in this Section 1.3. Each Party is responsible for all acts and omissions of its Representatives. The foregoing obligations will not restrict either Party from disclosing Confidential Information of the other Party pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body of competent jurisdiction, provided that the Party required to make such a disclosure gives reasonable notice to the other Party to enable such Party to contest such order or requirement, unless such notice is prohibited by law. The restrictions set forth in this Section 1.3 will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

Webiny shall comply with its obligations under the data processing addendum set forth and incorporated hereto as Exhibit B. All data, information, and materials provided by or on behalf of Customer shall be Customer Content, and all Customer Content shall be Customer's Confidential Information. Webiny shall only use the Customer Content to provide the Services to Customer.

### 1.4 Defense of Claims.

The Parties will indemnify, defend and hold harmless each other against third-party claims, as and to the extent set forth in this Section 1.4 and will pay the amount of any resulting adverse final judgment or approved settlement, but only if the defending Party is promptly notified in writing of the claim and has the right to control the defense and any settlement of it. The Party being defended must provide the defending Party with all reasonably requested assistance, information, and authority. The defending Party will reimburse the other Party for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses it incurs in providing assistance, and will not settle or make any admissions with respect to a third-party claim without the other Party's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. This Section 1.4 describes the Parties' sole remedies and entire liability for such claims.

#### 1.4.1 Webiny.

If Webiny is unable to resolve an Intellectual Property Claim under commercially reasonable terms, it may, at its option, either: (a) modify, repair, or replace the Software or Service (as applicable); or (b) terminate Customer's subscription and refund any prepaid, unused subscription fees. Webiny will have no obligation under this Section 1.4.1 for any Intellectual Property Claim arising from: (i) modification of the Software or Service, or the combination, operation, or use of the Software or Service with equipment, devices, software, systems, or data, other than as expressly authorised by this Agreement (including the Documentation); (ii) Customer's failure to stop using the Software or Service after receiving written notice from Webiny to do so; (iii) products or services that are provided by Webiny free of charge; or (iv) access or use of Beta Previews.
