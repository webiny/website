If you're reading this article, you might be interested to learn how to implement user management
for your application, understanding the complete picture of how identity management services work.
That's what we'll do in this article. You'll learn what is Identity as a Service (IDaaS),
why to use such a service, what is Single Sign-On (SSO), and IDaaS platforms.

Let's dive in!

## What is an Identity Provider as a Service (IDaaS)?

### Manual user identity management

In order to get access to an application, back in the days, you would have to share your credentials
such as your username and password with the application maintainers.

For a developer, user identity management is a complex feature to build and manage, especially
security-wise. You'd be responsible if someone would gain access (hack) into the users' identities and use those for their purposes.

Let's go through a real-life scenario where your client has requested to implement the Login/Registration
feature for the application you're building.

Inspired by the <ExternalLink href="http://dev.to">dev.to</ExternalLink> platform, as seen in the image below,
your client wants to give the users an option to access the application using the social accounts such
as Twitter or GitHub.

### **Open Authentication and OpenID Connect protocols**

After some research, you learn that to implement this feature there are **internet standards** you have to use,
such as **Open Authentication 2.0 (OAuth 2.0), and OpenID Connect (OIDC).**

**OAuth** is a **security standard** where you give one application permission to access your data in another
application - instead of giving them your **username** and **password** - you give one app **a key**
(in this case the Twitter or Github key). We (the internet) refer to this as **authorization.**
You authorize the [dev.to](http://dev.to) platform to **access your data** on Twitter or GitHub on
your behalf, without giving them your **password**.

Using the **OAuth 2.0** standard, you will implement the requested feature for your client, giving the
users the option to access the platform via 3rd party services.

**But where does the OIDC come in?** The dev.to case is a simple authorization, the client will not have
access to your data. When the client requires your personal information, that's where the **OIDC** comes in.

**OIDC** is a thin layer that sits on top of **OAuth 2.0** and gives access to personal information
(like first and last name, for example). **OAuth** enables authorization from one app to another,
and the **OIDC** gives the information about the person that is logged in, which is often called **identity.**

When the **authorization server\*** (the Twitter or GitHub applications) supports **OIDC**,
it is sometimes called an **Identity Provider** - since it provides information about
the **resource owner\*** back to **the client**. However, you will only be able to authenticate
using the particular service credentials.

With a proper IDaaS (Identity as as Service) provider, you'll be able to configure more
ways to authenticate, and have one centralized layer of access control.
Let's learn more about what IDaaS is in the following section.

### **Identity as a Service provider (IDaaS)**

To better understand what is an IDaaS, we'll continue with the context of the client who has other requests regarding the login/registration feature.
The client, inspired by the <ExternalLink href="http://acloudguru.com">acloudguru.com</ExternalLink> platform,
requires implementing another 5-6 options to login/register, as seen in the image below:

![acloudguru login](./assets/what-is-idaas-and-why-use-one/acloudguru-login.png)

Implementing 5-6 other services will require a notable effort, and with that comes the maintenance overhead.

But, you don't have to implement those services from scratch.
You can use an Identity-as-a-Service platform such as **Auth0**
(there are others too, we'll talk about them alter in the article).

_Wait, what is Auth0?!_

**Auth0** is a cloud-based system that provides solutions for businesses' user and
identity management processes. **Auth0** can manage tasks such as registration, login,
and password reset, naming a few. So, **Auth0** provides a platform for authentication,
authorization, and secure access for applications, devices, and users.

Using **Auth0**, you can implement the additional services super fast. **Auth0** offers
developers the option to prove an app's or an API’s authenticity using different
**identity providers (**GitHub, Twitter, Facebook, Google, etc.**)**, whatever the platform may be.

### How does IDaaS actually work?

To use an IDaaS, you don't need to be an expert on the identity protocols such as **OAuth**
or **OIDC** we talked about earlier. Let's go through a typical IDaaS authentication flow using
Auth0 as an example (but the same flow applies to all other IDaaS providers).

You first integrate your app with **Auth0** (using their SDK). Then, when a user tries to login,
your app will redirect the user to an **Auth0** customizable login page, where he logs in
either using username/password combination, or a 3rd party authorization server (Twitter, Github, etc.).
Once logged in, the user is redirected back to your app with an authorization code,
which is then exchanged for a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/json-web-tokens)
from Auth0. The JWT will then be used to call your APIs, and will also contain basic information about the user.

A cloud guru (**ACG**): **ACG → Auth0 → GitHub (**3rd party authorization providers**) → Auth0 → ACG**

- **ACG** is only communicating with **Auth0**

**Auth0** provides an amazing dashboard for you when you sign up, allowing you to see recent logins, new sign-ups, and total user counts.

![Auth0 dashboard](./assets/what-is-idaas-and-why-use-one/auth0-dashboard.png)

## **What is SSO?**

IDaaS enables scenarios where **one login** can be used **across multiple applications**,
also known as a **Single-Sign-On** or **SSO**.
If all your apps use, for example, **Auth0,** to get the identity information,
then you can see how they are all talking to the same source of truth.

IDaaS internally is taking care of 3rd party authorization providers
(GitHub, Twitter, and many others) and then links everything into 1 single identity profile.

**SSO** login means that a user logs into an app with one set of credentials and
automatically is signed into all other apps that are linked to his profile within
the IDaaS provider. With **SSO**, the end-user gains access to multiple apps without
having to remember multiple credentials for different apps and login into each individual app.

A real-life example of **SSO** is Google, for it has plenty of software products.
Once you login into Gmail, you can automatically access YouTube, Google Drive,
Google Photos, and other Google products, as shown in the image below.

![Google apps](./assets/what-is-idaas-and-why-use-one/google-apps.png)

### The key benefits of SSO Login

- **Increased productivity**

  A single source of truth will reduce the time that was wasted.
  Now, users with just one password can access all apps from one organization.
  The UX is improved as well: there's no need to login multiple times, or reset passwords in each individual app.

- **Improving security**

  It is now easier to enforce password policies across the entire organization
  as well as enable multi-factor authentication across all apps.

- **Password fatigue**

  When you have multiple passwords to remember, it leads to "password fatigue".
  With **SSO,** the user has at most one password to remember.
  Or none at all, if using 3rd party authorization providers linked to your IDaaS.

## Why should you use an IDaaS provider?

Using an IDaaS can help in different aspects, such as with end-users and business management.
Some key benefits to using an identity provider are:

- No need to build and maintain your own user database, setup authentication, and manage usernames and passwords.
- Quick and easy self-registration to your custom applications.
- Users don't need to remember additional passwords.

**Customer Benefits of Using an IDaaS**

- **A great user experience**

  Customers will have a single identity to navigate between multiple applications they use.

- **Password protection**

  With IDaaS users will use a single password, making it easier to generate, remember, and recover/reset.

- **Time saving**

  Here is a fact check:

  > Johns Hopkins estimated significant time savings by users since the
  > deployment of "Tap and Go" to date, with time savings in September
  > 2012 alone estimated at 2,550 man-hours... consistent with the time
  > savings reported in July and August 2012, the initial months of the
  > implementation.

**Business Benefits of Using an IDaaS**

- **Improves return on investment (ROI)**

  Implementing identity management services is a critical component for your company's approach to security, but putting one in the work has an effect on the bottom line of your company's function. How does it improve the return on investment (ROI)?

  Using an identity management system you can save money by:

  - Reducing help desk issues
  - Increasing employee productivity
  - Increasing IT efficiency

- **Security**

  When end-users access 3rd party websites, the credentials are not stored and managed externally and this makes it risk-free.

- **Control**

  Organizations have control over the user and the resources they access from one location within the infrastructure.

- **Scaling**

  Having a central identity provider is the foundation of building a highly scalable organization.
