Thank you everyone for your overwhelming response to our community calls.
We will have our next community call on 28th April 2022 (Thursday) at 1:00 pm GMT!

In our efforts to make it much easier for teams to get started with the Headless CMS with the starter kit. After Next.js, we are pleased to announce the **Gatsby starter kit**. Ben Read from our DevRel team will walk us through a quick demo of how to use it.

We will also dive into the **Advanced Publishing Workflow demo**. We just wrapped up this feature and are excited about shipping it soon. And, of course, if you have any questions related to Webiny or serverless, be ready with them.
