#### HEADLESS CMS

‚úÖ **Fully Delete a Content Model and All Entries**

Now, you can completely remove a content model along with all of its entries and folders. This ensures a clean but also irreversible deletion process, preventing outdated or unused models from cluttering your CMS. Use this feature with caution, as deleted entries cannot be restored.

‚úÖ **Full-Screen Editor for Content Entries**

We‚Äôve introduced a full-screen editor for a more immersive content creation experience! This new interface enhances usability, especially on smaller screens, while aligning the design with our Page Builder editor for a consistent workflow. If needed, you can revert to the previous editor using the cmsLegacyEntryEditor: true feature flag.

#### DEVELOPMENT

‚úÖ** Yarn 4.6.0 Upgrade**

We‚Äôve upgraded to Yarn 4.6.0, ensuring compatibility with the latest features and improvements. For a seamless transition, check out our upgrade guide.

‚úÖ **New Logger for System Monitoring**

Webiny now includes an internal Logger that records errors and other critical system information in a DynamoDB log table. While this feature is mainly for internal use, developers can leverage it for additional monitoring needs.

‚úÖ **Updated Dependencies**

We‚Äôve updated several dependencies to improve stability and performance. The upgrade process will notify you if any of your project‚Äôs packages are out of sync and provide an option to align them with Webiny‚Äôs latest versions.

‚úÖ **Removed apps/api/graphql/src/types.ts (New Projects Only)**

New Webiny projects will no longer include the types.ts file. Instead, the Context interface can be imported directly from the @webiny/api-serverless-cms package, ensuring a more streamlined and type-safe development experience.

‚úÖ **MailerContext Added to the Context Interface**

Developers can now access the mailer object in a type-safe way when writing backend extensions, enabling seamless email integration.

#### DEPLOYMENTS

‚úÖ **Default Throttling Limits for Amazon API Gateway**

To prevent excessive request failures, we‚Äôve introduced default throttling limits:

üîπ Burst limit: 5000 (maximum concurrent requests)

üîπ Rate limit: 10,000 (requests per second)

You can customize these limits in your webiny.application.ts configuration if required.

üö® This release does NOT introduce any major breaking changes, but if you are upgrading from an older version, be sure to check our upgrade guide.
