## **Moving to a Self-Hosted Model With Serverless Framework**

When we started [Webiny](https://www.webiny.com/), we wanted to make it as easy as possible to create and run a serverless website. While we were exploring how to best achieve that, we ended up going with a proprietary cloud solution.

This solution allowed us to deploy a serverless project with a single command. Users benefitted from the ability of a fully managed and secure platform. Over time, a lot of users approached us and asked how to self-host their sites. Unfortunately, due to proprietary technology, there was no easy way of doing that.

At the same time, our focus, energy, and other resources were split between developing a great product and managing and improving our proprietary serverless cloud platform. However, it’s better to do one thing right than everything poorly.

## Serverless Framework

If you haven’t heard about [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/) already, they are the best tool, in our opinion, for managing deployments of serverless applications.

We have designed Webiny to fit nicely with their new [Serverless Components](https://serverless.com/components/). Together with the help of their community, we managed to reach our goal: a self-hosted Webiny with a simple deployment mechanism. We, therefore, wish to send a special thanks to [Eslam Hefnawy](https://serverless.com/author/eslamhefnawy/) from the Servlerss Inc team for helping us out.

Deploying Webiny is now a simple matter of running the “webiny deploy-*” commands in your terminal, and off you go.

### What about other cloud providers?

We have multi-cloud support for Webiny on our roadmap; it’s something we’ ll be investing substantial amounts of resources and effort into since we believe the multi-cloud requirement will be one of the most asked features in the near future. If you already have this requirement on your list, [let us know](https://www.webiny.com/contact-us), as we would love to have a chat with you.

## Migration path

We understand that the move to a self-hosted platform might cause inconvenience for some of your projects. We are here to assist you and provide you with guidelines on how to migrate off from our managed cloud and setup everything inside your own AWS account.

[Please, contact us with the details of your project and our team will engage with you and provide all the assistance required.](https://www.webiny.com/contact-us)
