## 🆕 What’s New In Webiny 4.8.0?

In this week’s release, we introduce a couple of improvements and fixes in different areas of Webiny. Let’s check them out!

## 🚀 Features

- **New CLI **`info`** command **([#1171](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1171))

Ever found yourself looking for the URLs of the API and site you’ve previously deployed? If the answer is yes, well, don’t worry, we’ve been there too. 🙂

But, with this week’s release, this issue is the thing of the past. With the new `yarn webiny info` command, you immediately get all of the relevant URLs, across all of the environments you might've previously deployed.

Check the screenshot to see it in action!

- **New scaffolds (**[#1170](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1170)**)**

In this week’s release, we are introducing four new scaffolds that you can use to significantly speed up your development. Let’s take a look.

> In order to access the list of all available scaffolds, `run yarn webiny scaffold`. From there, you can select the scaffold you need.For more information on scaffolding, make sure to visit our [official docs](https://docs.webiny.com/docs/deep-dive/cli/creating-a-scaffold-plugin/#introduction-to-scaffolding).

- **1. Admin App Module** ([#1170](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1170))

Let’s start with the most important scaffold. The `Admin App Module` the scaffold will essentially create a new module in the Admin app. Meaning, it will generate a set of plugins that will insert a new section in the Admin app's main menu and create a new route that will render the default view that consists of a list of all records and a basic form. In other words, it's a view that provides the complete CRUD functionality, which can be then adjusted to your needs, by adjusting the GraphQL queries/mutations, the list, the form, and so on.

- **2. React Application** ([#752](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/752))

By default, a new Webiny project comes with the Admin and Site apps, which you are free to expand in any way you might need. But, if those two apps are not enough, with the newly added React Application scaffold, you can easily create additional ones. Imagine you had a secure area on your public website that your users can access. In that case, this scaffold might be an ideal tool for you, as the secure area might be a totally separate app.

- **3. React Package** ([#1134](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1134))

Next up, we have the React Package scaffold, which will essentially create a couple of simple files for getting started with a new React package, for example, creating a new React component or set of components.

- **4. Node Package** ([#1135](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1135))

Finally, the Node Package scaffold will enable you to quickly start with a simple Node.js package, similar to what the React Package scaffold is trying to do as well. This can be used to start creating libraries that you might need to share across all of your apps or APIs.

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

- **Scaffolding**: update “exclude” and “reference” paths if needed ([27085cf](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/commit/27085cf96a612f47956d68fb54fd0ed7b7d24823))
- **CWP templates**: add a post-install script to properly link monorepo packages ([ba1f28d](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/commit/ba1f28d9508f224bdc1af31e5b3b36e64af2256f))
- **Page Builder App**: increase z index on File Manager overlay ([#1157](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/issues/1157)) ([193d2fc](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/commit/193d2fcd0e2f460652760d3f1b909c4287ce9798))
