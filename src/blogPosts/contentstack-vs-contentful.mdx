In the modern digital era, content needs to be accessible and adaptable across several devices and channels, not just websites. Traditional content management systems (CMSs) with tightly coupled front ends and back ends are architecturally incapable of delivering this omnichannel flexibility.

This is why more and more businesses are turning towards [headless content management system](https://www.webiny.com/enterprise-serverless-cms/headless-cms). These platforms decouple the presentation layer from the back end to allow marketers and developers greater flexibility over how content is delivered.

Digital teams can use a centralized content repository to serve content to as many channels as needed, including websites, mobile apps, kiosks, and conversational interfaces.

In the headless CMS industry, two names stand out for their extensive feature sets, established communities, and proven track records: Contentstack and Contentful. But which one is a better fit for your specific needs?

This article will perform a detailed headless CMS platform comparison of Contentstack vs. Contentful across key categories like ease of use, performance, scalability, and more.

We’ll also introduce [Webiny](https://www.webiny.com/), an emerging, enterprise-ready Contentstack and Contentful CMS  alternative that’s challenging the established players with its unparalleled customizability and auto-scalable architecture.

By the end, you should have a clear idea of the platform that best aligns with your business’s goals.

## Headless CMS comparison: Contentstack vs. Contentful

Both Contentstack and Contentful offer reliability and efficiency in managing digital content, making either a solid option. However, to help you make an informed choice that perfectly aligns with your business’s needs, we’ll present a comprehensive evaluation checklist in the following sections.

## Ease of use

#### Contentstack

The “modular blocks” feature enables marketers to build dynamic pages on the go via a drag-and-drop interface. The built-in AI assistant allows content creators to leverage ChatGPT natively for content creation.

For developers, Contentstack offers native SDKs and starter kits to speed up the development process. It also comes with a CLI for automating common tasks via built-in commands.

#### Contentful

Similar to Contentstack, Contentful comes with a GraphQL content API which allows developers to fetch filtered, sorted, and paginated data.

## Customizability

#### Contentstack

As a Contentful alternative, Contentstack gives you the freedom to build fully customizable decoupled front ends for your apps. However, since it’s a proprietary platform, you can’t customize core back-end functionalities, like modeling or data storage. Nevertheless, users have the option to install extensions or add-ons to augment some of the platform’s capabilities.

#### Contentful

Like Contentstack, Contentful is a closed-source headless solution, allowing you to build personalized front ends. However, it offers no way to customize core back-end features.

That said, the Contentful Studio offers some interface customization options for marketers and content creators. Users can also install third-party extensions from the marketplace.

## Performance and scalability

#### Contentstack

Contentstack has a fault-tolerant distributed architecture that delivers high levels of performance and scalability. Users also have the option to create branches to provision new clients or sites on the same instance. However, it’s important to note that the number of branches is not unlimited, which may be a constraint for scaling projects.

## Integration ecosystem

#### Contentstack

#### Contentful

Contentful is a proprietary, closed-source solution with no open-source components. Like Contentstack, it’s fully managed, hence you can’t choose to store your data or configure your infrastructure as per any regulatory requirements you may have. Those seeking greater customization may wish to look further for a Contentstack CMS alternative.

## Webiny: The new generation of headless CMS

Contentstack and Contentful are established headless CMS solutions, but they have certain limitations. Neither provides the ability to customize the backend or host within your own environment. Additionally, Contentstack’s non-transparent pricing structure can be a hurdle for some organizations.

Enter [Webiny](https://www.webiny.com/why-webiny), a Contentful and Contentstack alternative that’s an open-source, enterprise-grade headless CMS platform, that bridges these gaps. It delivers the same reliability as Contentstack and Contentful while offering [unparalleled customization](https://www.webiny.com/features/development-framework), scalability, and self-hosting freedom.

Let’s look at a few reasons why Webiny’s platform is becoming one of the go-to CMS options for forward-thinking [enterprises](https://www.webiny.com/enterprise).

### Self-hosted

Webiny rewrites the rules for enterprise-grade CMSs by allowing you to [host within your own AWS environment](https://www.webiny.com/features/self-hosted-headless-cms), and with upcoming support for other cloud platforms, it gives you unparalleled control over your infrastructure, data, and security policies.

### Serverless

Webiny runs on the [serverless infrastructure inside your AWS account](https://www.webiny.com/features/aws-serverless-infrastructure), delivering unprecedented levels of scalability and fault tolerance. Moreover, you can use Pulumi Infrastructure as code (IaC) to have full programmatic control over your infrastructure’s configuration and layout.

### Open source

Webiny is available as an [open source software under the MIT license](https://www.webiny.com/features/open-source). This means that, unlike Contentstack or Contentful, you can customize any aspect of the back end. You can rewrite the data storage layer, finetune the APIs, tweak the search algorithms, or tailor any other core functionality to meet your business’s needs.

### Cost savings

Being free and open source, Webiny slashes costs right off the bat. Moreover, with no servers to provision or manage, you can further expect up to an 80% decrease in maintenance costs compared to VM-based deployments.

- All third-party dependencies are scanned using Dependabot to reduce the chances of supply-chain attacks.
- With no servers to manage, the chances of misconfigurations and human errors are reduced.

- Enterprise customers can choose to deploy Webiny inside an existing Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

## Contentstack vs. Contentful summary: which headless CMS is the best?

Contentstack and Contentful are both battle-tested headless CMSs, but they may not be the ideal fit for modern enterprises. They have mature ecosystems and dependable architectures, but they lack two key ingredients that every modern enterprise craves: customizability and governance.

If you are looking for an enterprise-grade, fully customizable, self-hosted headless CMS, then [Webiny](https://www.webiny.com/) is a viable Contentstack and Contentful open-source alternative.

Its serverless architecture can scale better than its counterparts, and its open-source nature and self-hosting capabilities give you full control over everything. Moreover, it has some unique features that both Contentstack and Contentful lack, such as [native multi-tenancy](https://www.webiny.com/features/multi-tenancy-site-management) and IaC.
