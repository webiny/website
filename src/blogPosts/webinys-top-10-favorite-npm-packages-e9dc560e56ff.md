At Webiny we do have the `package-of-the-day` slack channel where we post our favorite NPM packages daily 🙃

Below, we listed our top 10 favorite NPM packages. 🚀

## 1. Contreebutors

[`Contreebutors`](https://github.com/doitadrian/contreebutors) — A small library that makes it easy to keep a list of all people that contributed to a project (most often an open-source project). It’s really easy to use — just run the `contreebutors add --username {GITHUB_USERNAME}` command and the tool will add the given contributor to the `contreebutors.json` file, and more importantly, update the list of all contributors at the end of your project's `README.md` file.

[`Githug`](https://github.com/Gazler/githug) — Is designed to give you a practical way of learning git. It has a series of levels, each requiring you to use git commands to arrive at a correct answer.
