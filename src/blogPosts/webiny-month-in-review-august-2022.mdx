A new release, four new tutorials, and a GitHub star milestone! Welcome to the Webiny Month in Review newsletter.


## Six Thousand GitHub Stars

We did it. 6 thousand stars represents a huge milestone. Thank you to each and every one of you here in our community, you've really made a huge difference to us getting this far. 


Getting this many GitHub stars validates that we've got something really special here, and helps us see that people are really interested in the power of Serverless and in Webiny in particular

It's awesome to have you on this journey with us.

## Loads of New, Great Tutorials

Our community writer initiative is still going strong. We've had over 2 months of articles from a variety of authors on a raft of popular frontend technologies. Here's some of the highlights from the past month:

- [Build a Blog with Remix](https://www.webiny.com/blog/build-blog-remix-webiny-headless-cms)
- [Build a ToDo app with React and Tailwind](https://www.webiny.com/blog/todo-application-react-tailwind-webiny-headless-cms)
- [Build a Blog with Next.js](https://www.webiny.com/blog/build-blog-nextjs-webiny-headless-cms)
- [Implement Pagination using Vue](https://www.webiny.com/blog/implement-pagination-webiny-headless-cms-vue)

It's been awesome to see our writer community grow! As well as these beginner-friendly tutorials, we also published this more advanced tutorial for our developer community:

- [How to Build a Custom Field Plugin](https://www.webiny.com/blog/build-custom-field-plugin-webiny-headless-cms)

If there are any tutorials you'd like to see featured on the blog, please suggest one.

## Webiny 5.32.0 was released

While it didn't bring any new features to the table, v5.31 did include a lot of fixes for issues that were reported by our community members and also a couple of issues that we discovered ourselves.

- üêû File Manager: Fixed file type plugin
- üêû Fixes to the CI/CD Scaffold
- üêû Fixed an issue with the webiny destroy command, where, in order for it to work correctly, a Webiny project application had to be previously deployed
- üêû Admin Area: Dashboard widgets are now rendered correctly if you have more custom widgets (see image below)
