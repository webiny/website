## The Codebase: v5.33.3 is here

Recently we changed our release strategy. New features are only released in the end of each quarter, but we are always trying to upgrade Webiny and fix bugs for you, so the latest maintenance release v5.33.3 is already out. It is addressing some issues raised by community members, and some we found ourselves as well as offering small upgrades to existing features:

✅ All AWS Lambda Functions Are Now Assigned to VPC

✅ Add Support for Accordion Object Field Renderer

✅ Disable "Ripple" Effect and Minor UI Optimizations

✅ Report Invalid Part of the GraphQL Schema

✅ Show Content Model Field Renderer Name

Here is the detailed [Change Log](https://www.webiny.com/docs/release-notes/5.33.3/changelog?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=monthly-newsletter&utm_campaign=Regular-content&utm_content=month-in-review-december&utm_term=W00812) and [this is how you can upgrade](https://www.webiny.com/docs/release-notes/5.33.3/upgrade-guide?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=monthly-newsletter&utm_campaign=Regular-content&utm_content=month-in-review-december&utm_term=W00813) if you want to take advantage of the new code before the massive quarterly release which we are working on.
