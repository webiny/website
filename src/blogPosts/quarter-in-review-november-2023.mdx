## Check out the Webiny 5.38 Release! 

![https://www.webiny.com/docs/release-notes/5.38.0/changelog?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=monthly-newsletter&utm_campaign=Regular-content&utm_content=quarter-in-review-november&utm_term=W00880](./assets/quarter-in-review-november-2023/release.jpeg)


This release is packed with valuable new features inspired by our customers. Bringing on board new and more sophisticated clients has prompted us to reimagine some of the functionalities we provide in Webiny. 

We've bolstered our security management, introducing **Folder Level Permissions** for Enterprise clients to exercise finer-grained access control over their data. Additionally, we've introduced **Audit Logs**, an Enterprise feature that helps organizations track changes made across all Webiny applications. Webiny upgraded to **Node.js v1**, with v18 scheduled for next quarter. 

End users can now streamline their tasks with **Bulk Actions**, saving them valuable time. Furthermore, we've enhanced our search capabilities, allowing non-developers to execute and save complex queries with the **Advanced Search Filters** in the Headless CMS. 

Headless CMS received additional upgrades. We've added the ability to export and import models and **enhanced the Dynamic Zones (DZ)** by offering users the ability to create elaborate nested structures, e.g. adding Reference Fields, Objects, and Dynamic Zones in DZ Templates. We've introduced an **Entry Partial Save** option, allowing users to Save HCMS entries before they complete all the mandatory fields and validations. This is especially useful for complex models with hundreds of fields.

For Lexical, which is Webiny's default WYSIWYG editor, we've developed useful tools to facilitate **the conversion of HTML to Lexical and vice versa**, which proves handy when transferring data to and from Webiny.

Form Builder has received a new functionality - **Multi-step Forms**. This feature enables users to divide long questionnaires into several steps, thus maintaining simplicity and ease of completion. It serves as a stepping stone for us to offer you conditional logic in building your questionnaires and taking your customer interactions to the next level. üë©‚ÄçüöÄ




## Pre-Built Blocks are Now Available üöÄ

![https://blocks.webiny.com/?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=monthly-newsletter&utm_campaign=Regular-content&utm_content=quarter-in-review-november&utm_term=W00882](./assets/quarter-in-review-november-2023/pbb.png)

We created a collection of **100+ pre-built blocks** to help you accelerate your page design process. You can control the overall look and feel of your site using the theme and all of the pre-built blocks which you import in your system will use these guidelines by default. The beauty of it is that you can still take advantage of the pre-made designs, but also edit the pre-built blocks to your liking and ensure they are in alignment with your brand identity.  

To download and import the initial collection of our blocks follow this  [link](http://www.aicpa.org/soc4so?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=monthly-newsletter&utm_campaign=Regular-content&utm_content=month-in-review-january&utm_term=W00816).
