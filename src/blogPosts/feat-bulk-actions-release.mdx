In Webiny 5.38, we introduce a feature that significantly enhances your CMS experience  - the ability to perform Bulk Actions. Whether you're managing Headless CMS entries, pages, or assets, Bulk Actions **save you time and effort**, **making your content management process more efficient and your team more productive.** You can use them with Headless CMS, Page Builder and File Manager.

## Bulk Actions for Headless CMS

The following Bulk Actions are enabled out-of-the-box for Headless CMS. All you need to do is to select one or multiple entries and the bulk actions will appear at the top of the Advanced Content Organization (ACO) table.

- **Publish Entries** - you can select multiple HCMS entries to publish in one go. Please note, when you select entries which are in different statuses (e.g. ***Draft, Unpublished*** and ***Published***) for publishing, if they are in ***Draft*** or ***Unpublished*** status, they will be published and if they are in ***Published*** status- remain published.
    
    In the end of the operation, you will get a log to confirm that all the actions were completed successfully or flag the errors, if there are any. This applies to all Bulk Actions operations.

- **Unpublish Entries** - similarly when you unpublish entries with Bulk Actions, different statuses can managed together with this operation but it will not change the status of already ***Unpublishe*** or ***Draft*** entries.

We also offer developers the ability to customize the Bulk Actions available in the Headless CMS. Bulk actions can be added, replaced, or removed from the Entry list, to find out how, check out [this article](https://www.webiny.com/docs/headless-cms/extending/customize-entry-list-bulk-actions) on our documentation portal.

## Bulk Actions for Page Builder
The following bulk actions are enabled out-of-the-box to manage Pages:

- **Export Pages**- you can easily create a zip file with your Pages to import into another folder or project, or just use as a back-up.

- **Publish Pages** - when you select pages which are different in statuses for publishing - all of them will be published, if they are in ***Draft*** or ***Unpublished*** status, and they remain published, if they are already in ***Published*** status. Please note no re-publishing of the latter will take place.
