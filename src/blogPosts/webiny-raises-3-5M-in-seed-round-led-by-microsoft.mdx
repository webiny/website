It’s a great day for Webiny! We’re excited to announce that Webiny has raised $3.5M in a seed funding round led by [Microsoft’s venture arm M12](https://m12.vc/), with notable participation from [Samsung Next](https://www.samsungnext.com/), [Cota Capital](https://www.cotacapital.com/), [Episode 1](https://episode1.com/) and [YCombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/).

This is a huge milestone for our team but also our users and customers. I would, therefore, like to take this opportunity to share a few thoughts on some of our plans for the future.

## Learnings so far

When we started in 2019, we thought of Webiny mainly in the context of a serverless content management system. However, users and customers came and wanted to use our serverless platform for so much more. They wanted to build full-stack applications, scalable and performant APIs and fully control the security aspects around those. They saw Webiny as a potential platform to help them adopt serverless within their organisation.

## Not (just) a CMS anymore

With feedback from hundreds of organisations that have tried out Webiny, we decided to split Webiny into 2 different products. The [serverless CMS](https://www.webiny.com/serverless-cms), which you know from before, and a new [serverless application framework](https://www.webiny.com/serverless-application-framework) focusing on building full-stack apps and GraphQL APIs.

The key to a great developer experience lies in creating an opinionated solution - one that allows developers to focus solely on their business requirements instead of the complexities that come with the serverless infrastructure.

Webiny’s serverless application framework provides developers with a performant and ready-made architecture running on fault-tolerant serverless infrastructure designed to handle millions of users. Previously, to reach this level of performance, scalability and redundancy, organisations had to have entire teams of experts to build and manage such a solution, now, these capabilities are available within minutes.

## What’s next for Webiny

We’re receiving a lot of feedback on what we should build next, especially through our [slack community](https://www.webiny.com/slack), which is always great. We love to hear from our members that are passionate about Webiny.

In terms of the main items we’ll be focusing on next, I’m going to keep it brief as we’ll be sharing more information on those in the near future, but the main ones are:

1. Multi-cloud support, starting with Azure
2. Webiny Control Panel (more info soon, for now check our [roadmap page](https://www.webiny.com/roadmap))
3. Dynamic pages support for the Page Builder
4. Ongoing efforts to improve our documentation and developer experience

## Thank you!

Finally, none of this would have been possible without a team that truly believes in our mission supported by our existing investors and advisors. It’s a combination of many great things that came together at the right point in time, fueled by the amazing support and feedback coming from our amazing community. We wouldn’t have been here without you!
