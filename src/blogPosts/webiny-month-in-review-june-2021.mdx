## 🆕 What's New in Webiny?

Webiny `5.8.0` and `5.9.0` released in the past month. Also, we shipped our latest release 5.10.0 in early July and here are some of the highlighted release updates:

### 🚀 Features

**Node 12 Runtime and a New Sharp Layer <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1738">#1738</ExternalLink>**

With AWS deprecating Node 10 Lambda runtime, we've also upgraded all of our Lambda functions to use Node 12 (you may have noticed that File Manager Lambdas were using node 10). With that, we also released a new version of the Sharp layer, which is twice smaller, and also supports Node 14, so we have peace of mind for the near future.

**Admin Area React Application - Reduced Deployment Time <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1740">#1740</ExternalLink>**

Prior to `5.10.0` release, every time we'd deploy the Admin Area project application (`apps/admin`), all of the React application's production build files (JS, CSS, images) would be re-uploaded from scratch, even if we didn't perform any changes in our application code.

From now on, files whose content didn't change simply won't be uploaded. This will significantly speed up the deployment of the Admin Area project application.

**Improved Scaffolding and Development Workflows <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1720">#1720</ExternalLink>**

We've gone through a complete overhaul of the existing GraphQL API Package and Admin Area Package and significantly improved the GraphQL and Admin Area scaffold along with various visual improvements.

**Preloading and Caching Improvements <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1753">#1753</ExternalLink>**

Improvements to the prerendering service, handling of missing cache-control response headers and enchantments to asset preloading will improve the page load times for pages created with <ExternalLink href="https://www.webiny.com/serverless-app/page-builder?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=blog-post&utm_campaign=Regular-content&utm_content=webiny-month-in-review-june-2021&utm_term=W00672">Webiny Page Builder</ExternalLink>.

**Reorganization of Security Packages <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1693">#1693</ExternalLink>**

The security layer in Webiny consists of plugins spread across several packages. Up until now, it was difficult to navigate these packages and understand the responsibilities of each one of them. We've restructured and refactored the code into packages with better naming, proper separation of concerns, and we've also introduced several new plugins to make integrations and extending easier.

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

**Handling emails that contain special characters <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1693">#1693</ExternalLink>**

There was a bug with user's emails containing special characters, like `john+doe@email.com`. The `+` would crash the app entirely once it made its way to the URL, like `/users?login=john+doe@email.com`. This is now sorted, and email addresses are now properly encoded/decoded.

A shoutout to <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/xintellion">@xintellion</ExternalLink> for spotting and reporting this one! 🙌

**Serving non-image files from CDN <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1710">#1710</ExternalLink>**

When files are uploaded via <ExternalLink href="https://www.webiny.com/serverless-app/file-manager/?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=blog-post&utm_campaign=Regular-content&utm_content=webiny-month-in-review-june-2021&utm_term=W00673">File Manager</ExternalLink>, ultimately, they must always be served to users over a CDN <ExternalLink href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon Cloudfront</ExternalLink>.
 This was true for images, but in every other case, files would be
directly served from S3, making the actual file download less optimal.

This has now been taken care of. Whenever possible, all types of files will be served from a CDN.
