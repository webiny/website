## Webiny Customer Success Story: MotorTrend üöÄ

![https://www.motortrend.com/](./assets/quarter-in-review-june-2024/motortrend.png)

** MotorTrend are live with Webiny!! ** üéâüéâüéâ

[MotorTrend](https://www.motortrend.com/) are the largest automotive media company in the world owned by [Warner Bros Discovery](https://www.warnerbros.com/?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=monthly-newsletter&utm_campaign=Regular-content&utm_content=quarter-in-review-june&utm_term=W00890). They tested several CMSes, but none, other than Webiny, could meet their demanding requirements in terms of scale and customization. They trusted Webiny as a headless CMS to manage their core car database with over 90M data points.

> It was a pleasure working with MotorTrend Group, the largest automotive media company in the world, on launching their new website, powered by Webiny of course. As you can imagine, such an undertaking is quite a challenge. From migrating a massive content portfolio with a large amount of assets, to putting in place a highly customizable publishing experience. The team at Motortrend pushed Webiny to deliver and helped us make the product better through this experience. But the success of such a project goes beyond just the right technology. It‚Äôs the people on both sides that collaborated and worked super hard in making the project a success.
