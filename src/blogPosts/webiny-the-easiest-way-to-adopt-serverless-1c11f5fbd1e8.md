## ⏳ Some backstory

While we were building Webiny, we had a modular CMS in mind as our goal. But this “modular” part, we wanted it to reflect in every part of the system. We eventually built a foundation that allowed us to expand and add new services to it while not getting caught into different challenges serverless infrastructure introduced.

When we launched we still thought of Webiny as serverless CMS, and this foundation was just a cool add-on feature which made Webiny easy to expand and customize.

After going live with the initial version we spoke to many users, web agencies, AWS partners, even investors. What we saw is that the excitement was more around the technical capabilities of our foundation and the problems it solves, and less about the CMS.

Essentially we learned we got our product the other way around.

## 👋 Meet Webiny — the easiest way to adopt serverless

Webiny is an open-source framework for building serverless applications.

Our focus is on providing organizations and individual developers with an easy and enjoyable experience when it comes to building products that run on top of a serverless infrastructure.

There are 4 core parts to Webiny.

1. **CLI** for creating, scaffolding and deploying projects
2. **GraphQL API** with Apollo Federation and embedded ACL for managing security and access rules
3. **Admin App** with many reusable React components for quickly creating new user interfaces
4. A set of ready-made serverless applications

To learn more about each of these, we have prepared some videos on our website — [https://www.webiny.com/features/](https://www.webiny.com/features/)

### The CMS is still there

Webiny apps, like [Headless CMS](https://www.webiny.com/serverless-app/headless-cms), [Page Builder](https://www.webiny.com/serverless-app/page-builder), [Form Builder](https://www.webiny.com/serverless-app/form-builder), and [File Manager](https://www.webiny.com/serverless-app/file-manager) are all still there. They are now an add-on to the core Webiny framework. Their goal is to provide additional support while building your serverless products.

We plan to keep maintaining and adding new features to these products as time comes.

### Why consider using Webiny for your project

If you’re thinking of using serverless infrastructure to power your next product, that’s great! We believe serverless is the future of web development, and you’ll definitely be on the right path.

However, jumping into a serverless project can be painful. Serverless masks many of its challenges and pitfalls in the beginning, and you only discover them later down the line, often when it’s too late.

Webiny gets around these pitfalls and provides you with a scalable foundation for all your serverless projects.
