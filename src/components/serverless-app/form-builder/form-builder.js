          <p>
            There are endless applications for the forms. Some of them might require quite specific rules for what users can write into a field. The UI supports different validation rules to be set. From simple rules to creating a combinations with several rules. This control ensures the form only accepts the correct value sets.

            Creating multi-language content is quite challenging. Creating a form with multi-language support is even harder. Webiny Form Builder has numerous features for this use-case.

            There are cases where you want to trigger specific actions each time someone submits a form. In some examples you might even want to notify and send the data to a 3rd party. Examples are zapier, slack and similar. Webiny Form Builder allows this integration via a webhook. All you need is the POST URL of the 3rd party.

            Once happy with how the form looks like, it's time to insert it into a page. The provided integration with Webiny Page Builder makes this super easy. It's a simple matter of dragging and dropping the form element into a column on a page. Once inserted you will select which form and which revision should to display.
