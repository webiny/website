            Serverless means that there are no servers you have to manage to run
            a particular service or an app. Usually, in Serverless architectures
            you rely on services that are managed for you. Be that
            function-as-a-service, storage-as-a-service, and others. Using
            managed services means that all the maintenance and operational
            tasks are abstracted away. Yes, there are still servers there, but
            they are no longer your responsibility to manage.

            A serverless application is one that is architected in a way where
            there are no containers or servers that you need to install,
            configure and later on manage or scale. Serverless applications run
            on services, instead of servers. In practice, this means that there
            is a reduced focus on infrastructure and an increased focus on
            business logic.

          <p>
            Backend is part of the application that is processed on the server
            and not on the client. In the case of a serverless backend, the
            server-side is actually processed in the cloud using a service. A
            service is typically a function, such as AWS Lambda. Therefore a
            serverless backend is a backend powered by a service instead of a
            server.

          <p>
            Serverless removes complexities around managing infrastructure and
            frees up developer resources. Developers no longer need to deal with
            configuring and installing different tools that their application
            requires, as those are now abstracted away as a managed service. In
            return, developers spend more time building business logic and less
            time on installing, configuring and maintaining infrastructure. This
            also means that products get faster to market and cost less to
            develop. All these advantages are driving the adoption of serverless
            and, over time, serverless will be the standard of how all
            applications are built.

            A serverless website runs on services like function-as-a-service,
            storage-as-a-service, and others. In its stack, it doesn’t have
            servers that need to be installed, configured or managed. That is,
            there are still servers, but they are managed by the service
            provider, such as AWS.

            Serverless development refers to architecting and building
            applications using managed services. The code that is written gets
            deployed to a service, instead of a server, where it's then
            executed. Serverless development often comes with certain challenges
            as not all services can be installed and run locally on a laptop, so
            often an Internet connection is needed.

          <p>
            Serverless functions are functions deployed to a
            function-as-a-service, such as AWS Lambda, Azure Functions or GCP
            Cloud Functions. Serverless functions by their nature are stateless.
            Once the function executes it gets deleted, together with its
            current state. Other features of serverless functions are that they
            are usually billed per execution and have (almost) unlimited scale.

          <p>
            Serverless architecture refers to the application architecture model
            where the underlying application runs all of its operations,
            including its business logic, on a set of services. Architecting
            applications in such a way comes with many advantages such as zero
            servers to manage, less time spent on infrastructure maintenance,
            better scalability factors and, in some cases, a much better cost
            model, one driven by usage.

          <p>
            Serverless compute refers to function-as-a-service (FaaS). In
            practice, this is a service to which you upload your code and the
            service executes the code on a specific trigger and returns the
            response.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            FaaS functions are stateless, they can be scaled (almost)
            indefinitely and offer a pay-per-request cost model. An additional
            advantage is that you don't need to manage a fleet of servers, load
            balancers or worry about networking rules. Because of these
            benefits, FaaS is one of the top serverless offerings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typical FaaS providers are services AWS Lambda, Azure Functions or
            GCP Cloud Functions.

          <p>
            Serverless Framework is an open-source library that simplifies the
            deployment of your serverless infrastructure. The framework is
            created by Serverless Inc and it’s published under the MIT
            open-source licence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Serverless Framework allows you to define your configuration using a
            YAML file, and then the provided CLI creates the required resources.
            Under the hood, Serverless Framework uses AWS Cloudformation.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a newer iteration of Serverless Framework called Serverless
            Components. This library, instead of using Cloudformation, uses
            native cloud SDK to create the infrastructure. As a result, the
            deployment times are significantly shorter, in some cases it’s up to
            25X faster than Serverless Framework.

          <p>
            Aurora is an AWS product in relational database service category.
            It’s a managed MySQL-compatible database. Aurora serverless is an
            iteration to the standard Aurora service where the compute part of
            the service is managed through an auto-scale feature. When the
            database instance is under a heavy load, additional compute
            resources are introduced automatically to handle the increased load.
            When there is no load, all the compute resources are removed. This
            way of operating the database comes with many benefits such as
            scalability, cost-effectiveness and operational simplicity.

          <p>
            Serverless CMS is a content management system architected to operate
            inside a serverless environment. This means that to run such a
            system you don’t need to install, configure or manage any servers. A
            serverless CMS such as Webiny runs on AWS Lambda, S3 and API Gateway
            services. Such an architecture allows the system to scale in and out
            much faster than traditional virtual servers, and it has a lower
            management cost when compared to containers.
