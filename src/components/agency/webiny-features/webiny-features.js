              </FeatureTitle>
              <FeatureDescription>
                Webiny automates code-splitting, image optimizations,
                prefetching pages and resources, server-side rendering, caching
                and much more. There are no knobs you need to be fiddling to get
                things working, and working fast. Webiny makes your team more
                efficient at what they do.

              <FeatureDescription>
                We don't want Webiny to have a steep learning curve, so we built
                it using the modern technologies your developers already use
                today - such as Webpack, Javascript, JS-in-CSS, hot-reloading.
                It's all there, connected and configured so they are ready to
                start building right away.

              <FeatureDescription>
                Building sites with Webiny doesn't require you to constantly
                build and deploy the whole website. Webiny is a dynamic system,
                edit a page, press publish and the page is live!

                Scaling and infrastructure management are things of the past
              </FeatureTitle>
              <FeatureDescription>
                Because Webiny is a 100% serverless system it scales up and down
                instantaneously with your demand. As an added benefit, there are
                literally ZERO servers for you to manage. Handling peak events
                like Black Friday and similar, it's gonna be "just another day
                at work" and you can forget about sleepless nights. And best of
                all, it will save you money and increase your bottom line.
