          <p>
            GraphQL brings numerous benefits over REST. However, some of the
            setup and configuration can be challenging. With Webiny, you’ll get
            a preconfigured environment and you can start creating your GraphQL
            API right away.

        <Cell title="Take the  microservices approach">
          <p>
            It’s the latest and greatest that technology provides, but sometimes
            it's quite hard to configure everything correctly. With Webiny
            you'll get the whole setup included for all your services. We also
            made deploying services super easy.

        <Cell title="Apollo Federation">
          <p>
            Having several APIs is usually a rule for any larger application. In
            many cases this ends up being a monolithic structure. To avoid that,
            Webiny uses Apollo Federation. It allows you to build your data
            graph using microservices distributed across multiple functions.

        <Cell title="Built-in access control layer">
          <p>
            The fine-grain ACL layer allows you to configure user access rights
            to the smallest scope. You can also issue API tokens for users to
            use inside 3rd party applications and services.

        <Cell title="Great performance with serverless functions">
          <p>
            Webiny sites runs inside a serverless environment. That offers
            unlimited scalability so no matter the load. Your users will
            experience great performance. Serverless also eliminates the need to
            over provision and overpay for infrastructure.
