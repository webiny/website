          <p>
            Our CLI allows you to shape your workflow by writing simple plugins. Even the default Webiny deployment mechanism is a plugin! Use community plugins or write your own, expanding your toolkit has never been easier.

          <p>
            When building on top of Webiny, you can use any NPM library out there, as
            well as you can connect and call any 3rd party API.

          <p>
            With Webiny you can create new GraphQL APIs, that are registered with Apollo
            Gateway. You can also create generic services that are invoked via an HTTP
            request on a specified URL.

          <p>
            Building and deploying microservices requires significant time. Webiny
            enables you to have your services up and running in less time and with less
            effort. Leaving time for more important things.

            Webiny sites runs inside a serverless environment. That offers unlimited scalability so no matter the load. Your users will experience great performance. Serverless also eliminates the need to over provision and overpay for infrastructure.
