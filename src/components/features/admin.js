                It's the perfect way to start building serverless applications.
                No need to waste time on configuring deployment scripts,
                webpack, and babel plugins or figuring out how to structure a
                project. With Webiny, just jump right in.

                Security is a crucial layer in any application. Webiny includes
                a full-featured security module that's also connected to the
                GraphQL API layer. The built-in UI, to manage users, groups, and
                roles, is intuitive and easy to use.

                Each user that has access to your site, will also have access to
                a module that allows them to control their profile. They can
                change their name, avatar, and similar info. They can also
                update their password.

                All the UI and processes are there for you to use and integrate
                into your own apps. The data is automatically synced with an
                authentication provider, like AWS Cognito.

              <p>
                The admin theme is inspired and influenced by Google Material
                Design. One of the more noticeable UI components is the search
                bar. It's a single bar that any module can register its own
                search function. There is also the option to register advance
                search filters to enable more powerful filtering.

                We have created over 30 React UI components while building

                The built-in admin theme is customizable through CSS and React
                components. The admin theme is built as a set of plugins that
                can you can extend and altered. Even the simplest parts, like
                the Webiny logo, are made as plugins that you can change. This
                gives you full control over the look and feel.

                Webiny uses AWS Cognito to handle user authentication and

                done behind the scene. By using AWS Cognito Webiny brings

                In case you want to use a different identity provider, like
                Auth0 or any other, you can do that by creating your own plugin.
