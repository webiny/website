          individual from which that person can be identified. It does not
          include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).
        </p>
        <p>
          We will collect personal data on this Website only if it is directly
          provided to us by you the user, e.g. your e-mail address, name, home
          or work address and telephone number, and therefore has been provided
          by you with your consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also use analytical and statistical tools that monitor details of
          your visits to our website and the resources that you access,
          including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs
          and other communication data.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal
          data about you which we have grouped together follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Identity Data (includes first name, maiden name, last name, username
            or similar identifier, marital status, title, date of birth and
            gender).
          </li>
          <li>Contact Data (includes email address and telephone numbers).</li>
          <li>
            Financial Data (includes bank account and payment card details).
          </li>
          <li>
            Transaction Data (includes details about payments to and from you
            and other details of products and services you have purchased from
            us).
          </li>
          <li>
            Technical Data (includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login
            data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location,
            browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform
            and other technology on the devices you use to access this website).
          </li>
          <li>
            Profile Data (includes your username and password, purchases or
            orders made by you, your interests, preferences, feedback and survey

            Usage Data (includes information about how you use our website,
            products and services).

            receiving marketing from us and our third parties and your

        <p>
          We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or
          demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from
          your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this
          data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For
          example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage
          of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine
          or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can
          directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as
          personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy
          notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you
          (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or
          philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political
          opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and
          genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about
          criminal convictions and offences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a
          contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when
          requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are
          trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with goods
          or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service
          you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under GDPR we will ensure that your personal data is processed
          lawfully, fairly, and transparently, without adversely affecting your
          rights. We will only process your personal data if at least one of the
          following basis applies:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            you have given consent to the processing of your personal data for
            one or more specific purposes;
          </li>
          <li>
            processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which
            you are a party or in order to take steps at the request of you
            prior to entering into a contract;
          </li>
          <li>
            processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to
            which we are subject;
          </li>
          <li>
            processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or of
            another natural person;
          </li>
          <li>
            processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in
            the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested
            in the controller; and/or
          </li>
          <li>
            processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
            pursued by us or by a third party such as our credit card payment
            processing, except where such interests are overridden by the
            fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require
            protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is
            a child.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate
          and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes
          during your relationship with us by emailing us at privacy@webiny.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to
          exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable
          fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
          Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these
          circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may need to request specific information from you to help us
          confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal
          data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
          measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person
          who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for
          further information in relation to your request to speed up our
          response.
        </p>
        <p>
          We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
          Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is
          particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
          case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
        </p>

          We may hold and process personal data that you provide to us in
          accordance with the DPA and GDPR.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information that we collect and store relating to you is primarily
          used to enable us to provide our services to you, and/or to meet our
          contractual commitments to you.
        </p>
        <p>

          uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. We may use your

          what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you.
          This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be
          relevant for you (we call this marketing). You will receive marketing
          communications from us if you have requested information from us or
          purchased goods or services from us or if you provided us with your
          details when you entered a competition or registered for a promotion
          and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.

          </li>
          <li>
            Where you have consented to receive our e-newsletters, from time to
            time, to provide these to you
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you are already our member or customer, we will only contact you
          electronically about things similar to what was previously advertised
          or sold to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a new member or customer, you will only be contacted if you
          agree to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don't want to be contacted for marketing purposes, please
          unsubscribe from our newsletter via the link at the end of each
          newsletter, or contacts us privacy@webiny.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note: We don't identify individuals to our advertisers, nor do
          we sell our data to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, if you don’t want us to use your personal data for any of
          the other reasons set out in this section, you can let us know at any
          time by contacting us privacy@webiny.com, and we will delete your data
          from our systems. However, you acknowledge this will limit our ability
          to provide the best possible products and services to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some cases, the collection of personal data may be a statutory or
          contractual requirement, and we will be limited in the products and
          services we can provide you if you don’t provide your personal data in
          these cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most
          commonly, we will use your personal data in the following
          circumstances:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or
            have entered into with you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a
            third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not
            override those interests.
          </li>
          <li>
            Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing
          your personal data other than in relation to sending third party
          direct marketing communications to you via email or text message. You
          have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by
          contacting us.
        </p>
        <h3>7. Where we store your data</h3>
        <p>
          As part of the services offered to you, for example through our
          Website, the information you provide to us may be transferred to and
          stored in countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) as we
          use remote website server hosts to provide the website and some
          aspects of our service, which may be based outside of the EEA, or use
          servers based outside of the EEA - this is generally the nature of
          data stored in “the Cloud”. It may also be processed by staff
          operating outside the EEA who work for one of our suppliers, e.g. our
          website server host, or work for us when temporarily outside of the
          EEA.
        </p>
        <p>
          A transfer of your personal data may happen if any of our servers are
          located in a country outside of the EEA or one of our service
          providers is located in a country outside of the EEA. If we transfer
          or store your personal data outside the EEA in this way, we will take
          steps with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be
          protected, as outlined in this privacy policy and in accordance with
          the DPA and GDPR. If you use our service while you are outside the
          EEA, your personal data may be transferred outside the EEA in order to
          provide you with these services.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not use or disclose sensitive personal data, such as race,
          religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may disclose your personal data outside of our group: (a) in the
          event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may
          disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such
          business or assets; and (b) if Webiny’s business is bought by a third
          party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will
          be one of the assets to transfer to the buyer. However, any such
          transfer will only be on terms that the confidentiality of your
          personal data is protected and that the terms of this privacy policy
          will continue to be complied with by the recipient.
        </p>
        <p>
          Otherwise, we will process, disclose or share your personal data only
          if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such
          action is necessary to comply with legal requirements or legal process
          served on us or the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          By giving us your personal data, you agree to this arrangement. We
          will do what we reasonably can to keep your data secure.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have the right to opt out of our processing your personal data for
          marketing purposes by contacting us at privacy@webiny.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although we try to provide protection, we cannot guarantee complete
          security for your data, and you take the risk that any sending of that
          data turns out to be not secure despite our efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to
          fulfil the purposes we collected it for as described above in section
          6, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or
          reporting requirements, and/or for as long as we have your permission
          to keep it. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal
          data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal
          data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure
          of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal
          data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means,
          and the applicable legal requirements. In any event, we will conduct
          an annual review to ascertain whether we need to keep your personal
          data. Your personal data will be deleted if we no longer need it.
        </p>
        <h3>8. Disclosing your information</h3>
        <p>
          We are allowed to disclose your information in the following cases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If we want to sell our business, or our company, we can disclose it
            to the potential buyer
          </li>
          <li>We can disclose it to other businesses in our group</li>
          <li>
            We can disclose it if we have a legal obligation to do so, or in
            order to protect other people's property, safety or rights
          </li>
          <li>
            We can exchange information with others to protect against fraud or
            credit risks
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not share your personal data with 3rd parties for any marketing,
          sales or other advertisement opportunities. The only thing we might
          share is aggregate statistical information about our visitors which do
          not contain any personal identifiable information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where any of your data is required for such a purpose, we will take
          all reasonable steps to ensure that your data will be handled safely,
          securely, and in accordance with your rights, our obligations, and the
          obligations of the third party under GDPR and the law.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we
          collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for
          another reason and that reason is compatible with the original
          purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing
          for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please
          contact us via email at privacy@webiny.com. If we need to use your
          personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will
          explain the legal basis which allows us to do so. Please note that we
          may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in
          compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted
          by law.
        </p>
        <h4>
          <strong>International transfers</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          We share your personal data within the Webiny community. This will
          involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area
          (EEA).
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of our external third parties are based outside the European
          Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will
          involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.]
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a
          similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least
          one of the following safeguards is implemented:
        </p>
        <p>
          · We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been
          deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by
          the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission:
          Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          · Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific
          contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data
          the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see
          European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data
          to third countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          · Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them
          if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide
          similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the
          US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy
          Shield.

        <h3>12. Automated Decision-Making and Profiling</h3>
        <p>
          12.1 In the event that we use personal data for the purposes of
          automated decision-making and those decisions have a legal (or
          similarly significant effect) on you, you have the right to challenge
          to such decisions under GDPR, requesting human intervention,
          expressing their own point of view, and obtaining an explanation of
          the decision from us.
        </p>
        <p>
          12.2 The right described in section 11.1 does not apply in the
          following circumstances:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              the decision is necessary for the entry into, or performance of, a
              contract between the you and us;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>the decision is authorized by law; or</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>you have given you explicit consent.</p>
            <p>
              12.3 Where we use your personal data for profiling purposes, the
              following shall apply:
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Clear information explaining the profiling will be provided,
              including its significance and the likely consequences;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures will be used;

          <li>
            <p>
              Technical and organizational measures necessary to minimize the

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              All personal data processed for profiling purposes shall be

              profiling.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>13. Security</h3>
        <p>
          We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your
          personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an
          unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access
          to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and
          other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only
          process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to
          a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal
          with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any
          applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do
          so.
        </p>
        <p>
          The transmission of information via the Internet or email is not
          completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your
          personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of data while you are
          transmitting it to our site; any such transmission is at your own
          risk. Once we have received your personal data, we will use strict
          procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized
          access.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password so that
          you can access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for
          keeping this password confidential. You should choose a password that
          is not easy for someone to guess.
        </p>
        <h3>14. Your legal rights</h3>
        <p>
          Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data
          subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the
          personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully
          processing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This
          enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about
          you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new
          data you provide to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to
          delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us
          continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete
          or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised
          your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have
          processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to
          erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that
          we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for
          specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable,
          at the time of your request.
        </p>
        <p>
          Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a
          legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something
          about your particular situation which makes you want to object to
          processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental
          rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are
          processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some
          cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds
          to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables
          you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the
          following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's
          accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not
          want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we
          no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend
          legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we
          need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.
          We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your
          personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
          Note that this right only applies to automated information which you
          initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the
          information to perform a contract with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to
          process your personal data. However, this will not affect the
          lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your
          consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide
          certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the
          case at the time you withdraw your consent.
