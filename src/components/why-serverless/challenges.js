            Webiny has a ready-made structure that works for any type of project, be that a website, an app or an API. To deploy and access a project, Webiny comes with a CLI that automates that for you. It takes a single command line to deploy the project. Using a CDN URL that you get back, you can access the project.

            Webiny has a built-in ACL that comes with a GraphQL integration. It has the ability to create users, roles, groups, and API tokens. It's all controlled via a friendly user interface. The whole logic is running inside a dedicated serverless function.

            A serverless function is a cloud-native service. So how do you replicate the whole setup on your local development environment?
          </p>

            <Bold>Solution:</Bold>
            {' '}
            You don't. There are a plethora of services, and differences in them between the cloud providers.
            {' '}
            The only way to get a 1:1 environment is to deploy your functions and test them inside the cloud. Our development setup does just that. This way you can rest assured that what you test in development, is how it will behave in production.
