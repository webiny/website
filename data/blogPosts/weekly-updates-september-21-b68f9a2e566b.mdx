## 🆕 What’s New In Webiny 4.12.0?

In this week’s release, we introduce a couple of fixes and improvements in different areas of Webiny. Let’s check them out!

## 🚀 Features

**Customize your SSR build** ([#1220](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1220))

You can now customize your SSR build by providing paths to your app HTML file and app component factory. In most cases, you won’t need it and Webiny defaults will work fine for you. But if you do find yourself in a situation where you need to tweak your HTML or app component — now you can do it. A shout out goes to [Latotty](https://github.com/latotty) for this and many other improvements in this release!

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

**Page Builder — overriding editor and page elements plugins work correctly** ([#1242](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1242)

This PR enables overriding parts of the Page Builder editor and page elements, which wasn’t possible before due to an issue in the order in which the plugins were registered internally. So, if you wanted to override existing plugins and modify existing or add new functionality to the page builder and/or page elements, you can do that now!

**Clean deploy output in CI environment** ([#1236](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1236))

When deploying infrastructure locally, there’s a status bar that shows the current state of the deployment process. However, CI environments are non-interactive, and dynamic logs like that cause a lot of useless noise in the output. We’ve now disabled dynamic logging when executed in the CI environment, so your logs are nice and readable 🎉.
